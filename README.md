# React Game Library App

React Game Library App is a video game discovery web app that helps you find new and interesting games to play. With React Game Library App, you can search for games by platform, genre, and more.

This is the project I've build to gain experience in React Development.

## Getting Started

To get started with React Game Library App, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Get a RAWG API key at https://rawg.io/apidocs. You'll have to create an account first.
4. Add a folder **config** in **src** and in this folder a file **secret.ts**
5. Add `const API_KEY = "{YOUR_API_KEY}";
export default API_KEY;` to the **secret.ts** file.
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the web server.
